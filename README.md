# Hydroponic monitoring

This is my final project for the Computer Engineering course at [Centro Universitário Fundação Santo André](https://www.fsa.br).
The project was based on a platform for the use of hydroponic greenhouse monitoring. The platform fills in its monitoring data using an integrated microcontroller (ESP32).
